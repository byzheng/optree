Description: Provides tools for managing nested, multi-level configuration systems with
    runtime mutability, type validation, and default value management. Supports creating
    hierarchical options managers with customizable validators for scalar and vector types
    (numeric, character, logical), enumerated values, bounded ranges, and complex structures
    like XY pairs. Options can be dynamically modified at runtime while maintaining type
    safety through validator functions, and easily reset to their default values when needed.
